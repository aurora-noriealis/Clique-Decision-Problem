# K-Clique Decision Problem
This is introduced as a final project for CSE545: Introduction ot Artificial Intelligence

## Problem Definition
The K-Clique Decision Problem (KCDP) is an NP-complete graph theory problem. 
In graph theory, a clique is defined as a set of nodes where every node is adjacent to the other.

**KCDP asks: does a clique of K nodes exist in the given graph?** 
This problem does not directly have applications to research. 
However, it is a commonly-used variant of the clique problem because it is NP-complete.
Other variants (such as Maximum Clique) are commonly related to communications, chemistry, and bioinformatics.

## Data
For initial development, simple graphs are presented from the [Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.cc/).
Additional data may be pulled from the [Network Data Repository](https://networkrepository.com/index.php).
